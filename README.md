- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dheckoi
- 👀 I’m interested in creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript applications for creative uses. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript to go along with the beautiful world of HTML and CSS. This is my first time using these platforms, but I could not stop once I started!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any learning tutorials and roadmaps to better understanding and a possible career change. 
- 📫 How to reach me... I will fill you in later. At this time it is unknown.
